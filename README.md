# AI-Optimized OS

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

**AI-Optimized OS** is a modified version of Pop!_OS tailored for AI development and system resource efficiency.

- **Base**: Pop!_OS
- **Modification Goals**:
  - Pre-install **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** for AI research.
  - Integrate **GPU performance monitoring tools**.
  - Add **smart resource allocation** using basic machine learning.

## ðŸš€ Part 1: Installation of TensorFlow and PyTorch

1. Run the installer:

   ```bash
   sudo bash install-scripts/install.sh
   ```

2. If the script executes successfully, reboot the system.

3. After reboot, run the post-install script:
   ```bash 
   sudo bash install-scripts/post-install.sh
   ```


## ðŸ“Š Part 2: Installation of GPU Monitoring Tools
1. Run:
```bash 
sudo bash install-scripts/gpu_utils_installer.sh
```
2. This installs:
    -    nvtop

    -   nvidia-utils-550

    -    nvidia-smi

    -   MissionCenter (via Flatpak)


## ðŸ¤– Part 3: AI-Based Smart Allocation of Resources

    Edit the following file:

```bash
./smart_allocator/ai_integration.py
```

Add your application names to the `LOW_PRIORITY_PROCESSES` list in the code.

    Run the AI integration script with elevated permissions:

```bash
sudo python3 ./smart_allocator/ai_integration.py
```

This script monitors system usage and adjusts process priorities dynamically using a simple PyTorch model trained on CPU/GPU load patterns.

CONTRIBUTION:

Vivek Kumar (23JE1090), Wali worked on Part 1, installation of tensorflow and pytorch. The install script is [here](./install-scripts/).

Vivek Kumar (23JE1091), Mani Sainath Reddy and Yuvraj Singh worked on the Part 2, installation of gpu monitoring tools. The install script is [here](./install-scripts/).

Vedaansh, Neharika and Shalini worked on Part 3, add smart resource allocation using basic machine learning. The smart allocator python program is [here](./smart_allocator/).

However, discussion and implementation of each points was discussed by entire team as a whole.
